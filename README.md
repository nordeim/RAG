*The application implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that processes various types of documents, extracts relevant information, and answers user queries using a Large Language Model (LLM)*

How to set up DeepSeek R1 on your local machine to securely query PDF documents using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), from downloading and configuring the model with Ollama to building a Gradio-based web app that processes PDF files using LangChain and vector databases. Whether you’re on a Mac or Windows, this video covers data preprocessing, text embedding, and semantic search, giving you a comprehensive understanding of local AI-assisted document queries without any reliance on the cloud.
