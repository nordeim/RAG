*Key Improvements & Features To Add:*

*1. Dual LLM Provider Support*

   > New radio button selects between Ollama/OpenAI

   > Dynamic UI shows API fields only for OpenAI

   > Unified response generation handling both providers


*2. Enhanced File Handling*

   > Uses file copying instead of moving for temp files

   > Added session state management for multiple queries

   > File reprocessing prevention with processed_files set


*3. Text Export System*

  > Export checkbox triggers text file creation

  > Exported files include original filenames as headers

  > Stores in RAG_source folder with user-defined name


*4. Improved UI Workflow*

  > Separate processing and question submission

  > Persistent session until Clear button clicked

  > Better error handling and user feedback


*%. Performance Optimizations*

  > Processes files only once per session

  > Reuses vector store between queries

  > Async-friendly design for future scaling


*Usage Instructions:*

  1. Select LLM provider (Ollama for local, OpenAI for cloud)

  2. Upload documents (multiple files supported)

  3. Set API parameters if using OpenAI

  4. Optional: Enable text export for future reuse

  5. Ask multiple questions without re-uploading

  6. Use Clear button to start new session


*Testing To Perform:*

  1. Verified both Ollama and OpenAI API endpoints

  2. Tested all supported file formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

  3. Confirmed text export functionality

  4. Validated session persistence across queries

  5. Tested error handling for invalid API keys/files

*Conclusion:*
New implementation maintains all original RAG functionality while adding the requested features in a user-friendly interface with proper error handling and state management.
