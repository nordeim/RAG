*ðŸŒŸ Design Specification Document for the Python Application ðŸŒŸ*

---

### **1. Overview**
This document provides a detailed technical design specification for the Python application provided in the attached file. The application implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that processes PDF documents, extracts relevant information, and answers user queries using an LLM (Large Language Model). 

The document includes:
- Detailed descriptions of the components.
- Code snippets as examples.
- Suggestions for future enhancements.

### **2. Functional Components**

#### **2.1 PDF Processing**
The application processes uploaded PDF files to extract text and split it into manageable chunks. These chunks are then embedded and stored in a vector database for retrieval.

**Key Functions:**
- `process_pdf(pdf_bytes: Optional[bytes]) -> Tuple[Any, Any, Any]`
  - **Purpose:** Loads the PDF, splits its content into chunks, and stores them in a vector database.
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    loader = PyMuPDFLoader(pdf_bytes)
    data = loader.load()
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100)
    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
    embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="deepseek-r1:1.5b")
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embeddings, persist_directory="./chroma_db")
    ```
  - **Details:**
    - *PyMuPDFLoader:* Extracts raw text from the PDF.
    - *RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter:* Divides the text into smaller chunks (500 tokens with 100-token overlap).
    - *OllamaEmbeddings:* Generates embeddings for each chunk.
    - *Chroma:* Stores the embeddings in a persistent vector database.

---

#### **2.2 Query Handling**
The application retrieves relevant chunks from the vector database based on the user's query and generates an answer using an LLM.

**Key Functions:**
- `rag_chain(question: str, text_splitter: Any, vectorstore: Any, retriever: Any) -> str`
  - **Purpose:** Combines retrieved chunks with the user's query to generate a response.
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(question)  # Retrieve relevant chunks
    formatted_content = combine_docs(retrieved_docs)
    return ollama_llm(question, formatted_content)
    ```
  - **Details:**
    - *Retriever:* Fetches the most relevant chunks from the vector database.
    - *combine_docs():* Concatenates the retrieved chunks into a single string.
    - *ollama_llm():* Sends the combined context and question to the LLM for processing.

- `ollama_llm(question: str, context: str) -> str`
  - **Purpose:** Formats the input and sends it to the LLM for generating a response.
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    formatted_prompt = f"Question: {question}\n\nContext: {context}"
    response = ollama.chat(
        model="deepseek-r1:1.5b",
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': formatted_prompt}]
    )
    ```

#### **2.3 User Interface**
The application uses Gradio to provide a simple web interface where users can upload a PDF and ask questions.

**Key Function:**
- `ask_question(pdf_bytes: Optional[bytes], question: str) -> Optional[str]`
  - **Purpose:** Handles the end-to-end process of uploading a PDF, processing it, and answering the user's query.
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    text_splitter, vectorstore, retriever = process_pdf(pdf_bytes)
    if text_splitter is None:
        return "No PDF provided or error in processing."
    result = rag_chain(question, text_splitter, vectorstore, retriever)
    return result
    ```

---

### **3. Logging and Testing**

#### **3.1 Logging**
The application logs key events to help with debugging and monitoring.

**Example:**
```python
logging.info("PDF processed: %d chunks generated", len(chunks))
```

#### **3.2 Testing**
A basic test suite is included to validate core functionality.

**Example:**
```python
def run_tests():
    from collections import namedtuple
    Doc = namedtuple("Doc", ["page_content"])
    docs = [Doc("Hello"), Doc("World")]
    combined = combine_docs(docs)
    assert combined == "Hello\n\nWorld", "combine_docs test failed"
    logging.info("combine_docs test passed")
```

### **4. Suggested Enhancements**

#### **4.1 Support for Multiple Files**
Currently, the application only processes one PDF at a time. To enhance usability, it could support multiple files and treat them as a unified knowledge base.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Modify `process_pdf()` to accept a list of PDF files.
- Combine all chunks into a single vector database.
- Update the UI to allow batch uploads.

**Example:**
```python
def process_multiple_pdfs(pdf_files: List[bytes]) -> Tuple[Any, Any, Any]:
    all_chunks = []
    for pdf_bytes in pdf_files:
        loader = PyMuPDFLoader(pdf_bytes)
        data = loader.load()
        chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
        all_chunks.extend(chunks)
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_chunks, embedding=embeddings, persist_directory="./chroma_db")
    return vectorstore.as_retriever()
```

#### **4.2 Exporting Processed Data**
To integrate with external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI), the application could export the tokenized and quantized version of the processed documents.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Add a function to serialize the vector database or chunks into a text file.
- Include metadata like chunk IDs and embeddings.

**Example:**
```python
def export_processed_data(vectorstore, output_file: str):
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        for doc in vectorstore.get_all_documents():
            f.write(f"{doc.page_content}\t{doc.embedding}\n")
```

#### **4.3 Multi-Language Support**
To cater to a global audience, the application could support Simplified Chinese alongside English [[7]].

**Proposed Changes:**
- Use multilingual embeddings (e.g., `sentence-transformers`).
- Allow users to specify their preferred language.

### **5. Conclusion**
This design specification outlines the current functionality of the Python application and suggests enhancements for scalability and integration. By implementing these improvements, the application can evolve into a robust RAG system capable of handling diverse use cases.

*ðŸ’¬ Suggestions for QA Test Cases:*
- Validate PDF processing for edge cases (e.g., empty PDFs, corrupted files).
- Test query handling with ambiguous or irrelevant questions.
- Verify logging for error scenarios.

*ðŸ’¬ Final Note:*
Understanding the nuances of programming languages and tools is crucial for building scalable systems [[1]]. Similarly, mastering English enables developers to communicate effectively in the global tech ecosystem [[3]].
