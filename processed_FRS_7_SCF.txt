It explains the causes for the changes in the cash balance. The statement of cash flow reports the inflow and outflow of cash by classifying cash receipts and cash payments according to the entity’s major activities, namely operating, investing and financing.  It focuses on the changes in cash position and company’s performance in generating cash.1.2	Use and Purpose of Statement of cash flows The statements of comprehensive income (SCI) and financial position (SFP) are common bases used in the preparation of statements of cash flows.  Learning to analyze and appropriately utilise financial data is one of the most powerful skills to acquire from accounting.  The statement of cash flows provides useful information for informed economic decision making. An analysis of a company’s statement of cash flows therefore reveals information about its cash receipts and cash payments during the accounting period, presented as operating, investing or financing activities.A company’s ability to finance operations, service debts and monitor cash and liquidity is important to the investors, creditors and management.  Generally, an organization’s past ability to generate cash is an indicator of its ability to meet future debt servicing and obligation.  To gauge a company’s ability to accomplish this task, investors and managers could look at the current ratio.  However, a statement of cash flows offers a more comprehensive basis for evaluation and assessment.2.	An overview of the Statement of Cash Flows Presentation of the Statement of Cash Flows: Items and ClassificationThe statement of cash flows should report cash flows during the period classified by operating, investing and financing activities.  Generally, cash flows should be reported on gross basis (#10 & #21).2.1	Cash and Cash Equivalents (#7 - #9)On a statement of cash flows, cash has a broader meaning than just cash on hand and cash at bank. It includes cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.  Some examples of cash equivalents are short-term fixed deposits and investments in short-term treasury bills. Bank overdrafts, which are repayable on demand, are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents (i.e. “negative” cash items).2.2	Cash Flows from Operating Activities (#13 - #15)Operating activities, generally, are the principal revenue-producing activities of the enterprise.  They are transactions and events that enter into the determination of net profit or loss of an enterprise.  Examples of cash flows from operating activities are:cash receipts from sale of goods and rendering of services;cash payment to suppliers and employees;payment of interest;payment of income taxes2.3	Cash Flows from Investing Activities (#16)Investing activities generally refer to expenditures made for resources intended to generate future income and cash flows. Examples of cash flows from investing activities are:acquisition and disposal of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other long-term assets;acquisition and disposal of equity and debt investments;cash advances and loans made to other parties or their repayments;dividends and interest received.2.4	Cash Flows from Financing Activities (#17)Financing activities refer to the provision of capital to the business. They include both equity and debt financing.Examples of cash flows from financing activities are:cash issues of shares;payment of dividendsProceeds from, and repayment of, short or long-term borrowings such as loans, notes, bonds, debentures and mortgages;repayment of lease liabilities.2.5	Cash Flows from Interest, Dividends and Income Taxes (#31 - #35)Cash received from, and paid for interest, dividends and income taxes should each be disclosed separately.  Each should be classified (as either operating, investing or financing activities) consistently from period to period.Note that classification and reporting of the above items within the scope of this module is per FRS 7 IE (Indirect Method):Income taxes paid			- Operating ActivityInterest paid 				- Operating ActivityInterest and dividends received	- Investing ActivityDividends paid 			- Financing Activity2.6	Non-Cash Items and Transactions (#43 - #44)Transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents should be excluded from the statement of cash flows.Examples of non-cash items or transactions are:depreciation;accruals of expenses or revenue;unrealised exchange gains or losses*;acquisition of assets via leasing;acquisition of assets by issuing shares;conversion of debt to equity;exchange of non-monetary assets;bonus issues of shares.* The gains and losses of year-end revaluation of foreign currency monetary items (e.g. cash and bank balances, loans, receivables, payables) on the statement of financial position (“SFP”). These amounts are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 3.	Preparation of the Statement of Cash Flows3.1	Cash Flows from Operating Activities (#18)Cash flows from operating activities can be reported using either the direct method (#19) or the indirect method.  The direct method reports separately major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments. The indirect method reports net profit or loss adjusted for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating receipts or payments, and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows.   The direct method is recommended by FRS 7 as it provides information that may be useful in estimating future cash flows; however, the Indirect Method is preferred in practice, and therefore adopted in this module.  Presentation format per FRS 7 Illustrative Example (“IE”) (Indirect method)3.1.1	Cash Flows from Operating Activities using the Indirect Method (#20)“Profit/(loss) before tax”, prepared on the accrual accounting basis, is adjusted for all non-cash items, non-operating activities items, items requiring reclassification and changes in working capital, to arrive at “Cash flows from operating activities”.  Therefore:Profit before tax +/- non-cash items (e.g. depreciation expense, impairment losses etc.) +/- non-operating or reclassified items (e.g. gain/loss on sale of fixed assets, interest expense)+/- changes in working capital (e.g. uncollected sales, unpaid expenses)= Cash flows from operating activities	Adjustment of Non-cash itemsIncome and expense items in net profit before tax, not transacted in cash.+Non-cash expenses-Non-cash income	E.g. depreciation, impairment lossesAdjustment of Non-operating items / Items presented separately Income and expense items in net profit before tax, which are not operating in nature, or to be presented separately (by definition of statement of cash flows).They are to be adjusted out of operating activities as they are presented separately in the statement of cash flows.+Interest expenses presented as interest paid-Interest incomeDividend income presented in investing cash flows+-Loss on disposal of non-current assetsGain on disposal of non-current assets presented in investing cash flowsEvaluation Only.
