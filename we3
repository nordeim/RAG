You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

*Your task:* dive deep into how an ideal "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)" tool should function, explore the sample code pasted below, and then create an improved version that is a complete fully working code without me having to edit it further.
```

Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want me to analyze the provided RAG code and create an improved, fully functional version. The original code is a Python script using Gradio for the UI, integrating Ollama and OpenAI models, and handling document processing for RAG.

First, I need to identify areas where the code can be improved. Let me look through the existing code step by step.

The code imports several libraries but has some typos, like "imp ort" instead of "import". These need to be fixed. Also, some dependencies are optional, like PyMuPDF and pytesseract. The code checks for these but might not handle all cases gracefully. Maybe adding more informative error messages or fallbacks would help.

Looking at the SessionState class, it manages the application's state. The load_config method merges the default config with the loaded one, but there's a typo in "merged_confi g". Need to correct that. Also, the save_config method has a typo in "CONFIG_FILE" as "CO NFIG_FILE". That's a critical error that would prevent saving the config properly.

The process_documents function processes uploaded files. It checks for new files not in processed_files, but the logic might have issues. For example, if the same file is uploaded again, even if modified, it might skip processing. The code uses file paths to track processed files, but if a file is modified and re-uploaded, the MD5 check isn't used here. Maybe the processed_files should track MD5 hashes instead of paths to detect changes.

In the convert_to_text function, the converters dictionary has entries for different MIME types. However, the image MIME types aren't explicitly listed. The code checks if the MIME type starts with 'image/', which is good. But maybe adding specific handlers for different image types could improve clarity.

The text splitting uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. The chunking parameters are set from the config, which is good. However, when new documents are added, the code appends them to the existing vector store. This is correct, but if the chunk size or overlap changes, the existing chunks might not be compatible. The code has a check in update_config that prompts the user to reprocess documents if chunk parameters change. That's a good safeguard.

The generate_response function retrieves context from the vector store and generates a response using the selected LLM. The system_prompt is customizable, which is a plus. However, the prompt construction could be more robust. For example, explicitly instructing the model to use only the provided context might prevent hallucinations.

Looking at the Gradio UI, the interface is divided into tabs for Chat, Settings, and Help. The Settings tab allows configuring the LLM provider, model parameters, and RAG settings. The code uses session state to manage configurations, which is correct. However, the UI could benefit from input validation, especially for numerical parameters like chunk_size and temperature.

Now, considering improvements:

Fix Typos and Syntax Errors : Correct all typos in variable names and function calls to ensure the code runs without errors.
Enhance Configuration Handling : Ensure that the configuration merging is done correctly, especially when sections are missing in the config file.
Improve File Processing : Use MD5 hashes to track processed files instead of paths to detect file modifications. Also, handle edge cases where files might be inaccessible or corrupted.
Robust Error Handling : Add more detailed error messages and logging for document conversion and processing steps to help users diagnose issues.
Prompt Engineering : Refine the prompt structure to explicitly instruct the model to base answers solely on the provided context, reducing hallucinations.
UI Enhancements : Add input validation for numerical settings, tooltips for configuration parameters, and better error display in the UI.
Code Structure : Refactor repetitive code into helper functions, such as for configuration validation and UI component updates.
Testing : Ensure that all dependencies are properly checked and that the code gracefully degrades when optional dependencies are missing.
Implementing these changes should result in a more robust, user-friendly RAG tool that handles various edge cases and provides better feedback to the user.

carefully review your improved code against the original code pasted, then create a detailed technical design specification document for your improved code. your design document should be detailed and contain at least 3000 words with clear explanations and with code snippets for each code block of your improved code. start the document with an overview of how a good RAG tool should work, follow by logical sequence of the code, end by a conclusion with summary and suggestions for future improvements.
```

Okay, I need to create a detailed technical design specification document for the improved RAG code provided. The user wants it to be at least 3000 words, with clear explanations and code snippets for each block. Let me start by breaking down the task.

First, the document should start with an overview of how a good RAG tool should work. I remember from the knowledge base that RAG combines retrieval of external data with generation. So I need to explain the key components: document processing, vector storage, retrieval, and generation. I should reference the sources provided, like the importance of documentation in software development [4] and the RAG methods from papers [2][7][9].

Next, the logical sequence of the code. The original code and the improved version have several parts: dependencies, configuration, document processing, vector store, LLM integration, UI. I need to go through each section, explain the improvements made, and include code snippets. For example, the improved code has better error handling and dependency management. I should highlight those changes and explain why they're important.

The conclusion should summarize the improvements and suggest future enhancements. Maybe things like adding more document types, better UI features, or optimizing performance. The user mentioned future suggestions in the previous answer, so I can include those.

Wait, the user wants the design document to be detailed. Each code block needs a snippet. Let me structure each section with a description, code snippet, and explanation of improvements. For instance, in the configuration section, the improved code uses atomic updates and schema validation. I should explain how that's better than the original.

Also, I need to make sure I'm using the correct sources from the web_search. For example, when talking about semantic search improvements, reference [10]. When discussing multi-agent RAG, mention [5]. Each section should tie back to the provided knowledge where applicable.

I should check the code for each part. The original had some typos and missing error handling. The improved code fixes those, adds more MIME types, better logging, etc. Each of these points needs to be documented with code examples.

Make sure the document flows logically: overview, then each component in the order they appear in the code, ending with conclusion and future work. Keep explanations clear and technical, but accessible. Use code blocks to illustrate changes and improvements.

Let me start drafting the sections:

Overview of RAG: Components and workflow, referencing sources.
Core Architecture: Dependencies, configuration, session state.
Document Processing: Conversion functions, metadata handling.
Vector Store and Retrieval: ChromaDB, embeddings, retrieval logic.
LLM Integration: Ollama and OpenAI, response generation.
User Interface: Gradio setup, event handlers.
Error Handling and Logging: Improvements over original.
Conclusion and Future Work: Summary and suggestions.
Each section will have subsections explaining the code parts with snippets. Need to ensure that each code block is properly formatted and the explanation ties into the technical aspects and improvements made.

Also, the user wants at least 3000 words. I need to be thorough in each section, providing detailed explanations. Maybe expand on each function, its purpose, and how it contributes to the overall RAG system.

I should also check for any missing parts in the improved code that the user might expect. For example, the original code had some commented-out parts or placeholders. The improved code addresses those, so I need to highlight those fixes.

Finally, ensure that all references to the web_search sources are correctly cited in the document where applicable. For instance, when discussing the system prompt, mention the importance of accurate context [1][3][4].

Alright, time to start structuring each section with these points in mind.
