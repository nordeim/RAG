I need to help the user by updating their RAG application code with the requested features. Let me start by carefully reviewing the provided code for simple_RAG_v4.py and identify any existing issues.

First, looking at the current code, I notice that the process_documents function moves the uploaded files to the RAG_source folder. However, when using Gradio's file upload, the files are temporary, so moving them might cause issues if the user tries to process them again. Also, the code uses shutil.move, which could fail if the source and destination are on different drives. Maybe using shutil.copy instead would be safer.

Next, for the enhancements:

1. Adding a checkbox for Ollama or OpenAI: The user wants a dropdown or radio buttons to select the LLM provider. The sample code for OpenAI uses the OpenAI client, so I'll need to integrate that into the RAG chain. The current code uses ollama.chat, so I'll have to conditionally switch between ollama and the OpenAI client based on the user's selection.

2. Input fields for API URL, Key, Model, and Temperature: These should be added to the Gradio interface. The OpenAI client requires base_url and api_key, so these inputs will be used when the user selects OpenAI. For Ollama, maybe the base_url can default to 'http://localhost:11434/v1' if left empty.

3. Export Text checkbox and filename: The user wants an option to export the converted text chunks into a file in RAG_source. The code already has the convert_to_text function, but the export should happen during processing. The process_documents function can be modified to write the combined text to the specified filename if the checkbox is checked. Also, each file's content should be prefixed with its original filename.

4. Allowing multiple prompts until clear: The current Gradio interface runs the ask_question function each time the user submits. To allow multiple queries without reprocessing files, the vectorstore and retriever should be stored in the session state. Adding a 'Clear' button to reset the session state would handle this.

Potential issues:

- The original code processes files every time a question is asked, which is inefficient. The enhancements should process files once and reuse the vectorstore for subsequent questions.

- The Export Text functionality needs to collect all converted texts, prefix with filenames, and save them in RAG_source. The current code converts each file to text but doesn't aggregate them.

- The OpenAI integration requires modifying the rag_chain function to use the OpenAI client instead of ollama.chat when selected.

- The Gradio interface needs to be restructured to include the new input fields and checkboxes, possibly using Blocks instead of a simple Interface for better layout.

Testing steps:

- Ensure that selecting Ollama or OpenAI correctly initializes the respective client.

- Verify that the Export Text checkbox generates the correct file with filenames prefixed.

- Check that multiple questions can be asked without re-uploading files.

- Test the Clear button to reset the session state and inputs.

Now, I'll start modifying the code step by step, integrating these changes while maintaining existing functionality.
