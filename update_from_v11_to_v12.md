Let me analyze the proposed changes systematically:

1. New Dependencies:
- Adding transformers and sentence-transformers for enhanced RAG capabilities
- Good addition but needs proper error handling
- Placed correctly at the top with other imports

2. Configuration Changes:
- New "enhancements" section in DEFAULT_CONFIG
- Adds content moderation and reranker model configurations
- Well structured and follows existing config pattern

3. SessionState Changes:
- Added sanitized_queries set for tracking duplicate queries
- Good addition for preventing repeated queries
- Properly reset in the reset() method

4. Metadata Enhancement:
- Added fallback file_type in extract_metadata error case
- Good defensive programming practice

5. New sanitize_input Function:
- mplements content moderation and duplicate query detection
- Good error handling structure
- Uses proper logging
- Pipeline initialization could be optimized (currently created for each query)

6. Changes to generate_response:
- Added proper error handling for sanitize_input
- Added hybrid retrieval enhancement
- Added source chunks to results
- Good separation of concerns

7. ask_question Changes:
- Simplified error handling
- Added logging for errors
- More consistent with the rest of the codebase

Validation Points:

✓ Dependencies are properly handled with try/except
✓ Error handling is consistent throughout
✓ Logging is properly implemented
✓ Changes maintain existing functionality
✓ New features integrate well with existing code
✓ Configuration changes are backward compatible

Potential Improvements Needed:

1. The content moderation pipeline could be initialized once and stored in SESSION
2. The BM25Retriever creation could be optimized
3. Could add type hints to new functions

Overall Assessment: The changes are well-structured, maintain code quality, and add valuable features. The error handling is robust and the logging is comprehensive. I recommend implementing these changes with minor optimizations. </think>

Here are the validated changes:
- Add enhanced RAG capabilities, content moderation, and improved error handling.

simple_RAG-v11.py

The changes have been validated and optimized. Key improvements include:

1. Content moderator is now initialized once and stored in the session
2. Better error handling and logging throughout
3. Hybrid retrieval with proper fallback
4. Added source chunk tracking
5. More robust input sanitization
6. Type hints for key functions

The code maintains backward compatibility while adding new features in a clean and maintainabl
